# Technical Exercise (Publish/Subscribe pattern)
 
We want to get a better understanding of a) the code you produce but also b) how you go about architecting an extensible solution and finally c) how you might explain a concept or pattern to others.

Rather than coding something in front of us, which is unrealistic in an interview situation, what we’d like you to do is produce a small solution that demonstrates the concepts of the Publish/Subscribe pattern.

It should:
 - Take an input of data
 - Transform that data in some way
 - Transport that data to a set of subscribers
 - Have the subscribers display the transformed data
 
This should be created in pure C#. You are free to use third-party libraries to help with some aspects of it.

Each part of the solution should be testable by design, we are not looking for 100% code coverage but show examples of how you might the individual parts are unit-testable.

When you come in we would like you to be able to describe your solution and use your solution to explain the concept of Publish/Subscribe and advantages or disadvantages it might have.

We can then talk about how we can extend and adapt your solution for more complicated scenarios and the changes that would be involved.
If you can please deliver the code to us before the interview so that we have enough time to have a look through your solution.

**Note: The test task is only a starting point for the conversation we’ll have during the interview. You should not try to use all the technologies / practices / patterns you outlined in your CV; you should not try to make this test task more complex than it’s necessary. We’d like to see a piece of code as you would do your daily working task.**
